\section*{Summary}
Type Theory is the one of the most promising approaches to formally
certified software and mathematics, being the base of tools like the
proof assistant Coq \cite{coq} and the dependently typed functional
programming language Agda \cite{Agda}. In the research proposed here
we are going to investigate and develop further a novel extension of
the type-theoretic approach based on a new connection between geometry
(Homotopy theory) and reasoning proposed by Field medallist Vladimir
Voevodsky. In a nutshell this \emph{higher dimensional type theory}
allows us to treat structures as first class citizens by viewing
equivalence of structures as equality. We anticipate that this
innovation will have substantial impact on the feasibility of large scale
formal development by supporting the replacability of components
without affecting the rest of the development. Our work will draw on
and create new connections between fundamental mathematical theories
like Homotopy theory and higher dimensional category theory on the one
side and formally supported software engineering on the other.

\section*{Part 2: Proposed Research}

Recently, the Field medallist Vladimir Voevodsky of the Institute of
Advanced Study in Princeton became one of the latest proponents of
formally developed, computer checked Mathematics. Voevodsky is now
using the interactive proof system Coq to support his work and
encourages his colleagues to follow suit. However, while impressed
with the potential of systems like Coq based on Type Theory Voevodsky
also proposed an important extension of the type theoretic approach
based on his background in Homotopy theory: Univalent Type Theory.
\cite{voevodsky,awodey}. 
Univalent Type Theory enables us to view mathematical structures as
first class citizens and identify equivalent structures as if they
were equal. While this is clearly important for the development of
Mathematics it also is essential for the development of a large corpus
of reusable and certified software allowing us to replace one abstract
module by another equivalent one without having to repeat the effort
of certification. While this is a long standing issue in the use of
abstract datatypes the novelty of Univalent Type Theory lies in the
possibility to view equivalent structures as equal which is not
supported by any existing approach.


\section{Background}

Type Theory ala Martin L\"of is at the same time a programming
language and a logical system based on the propositions as types
principle. The basic notions are $\Pi$-types generalizing the notion
of a function type from functional programming to a situation where
the codomain type can \emph{depend} on the actual input and on the
logical side covering the intuitionistic  explanation of the notions of 
implication and universal quantification. On the other hand
$\Sigma$-types generalize the notion of a product type (or record) in
functional programming and on the logical side allow us to model
conjunction and existential quantification. A 3rd central component are
equality types which assign to any two values the type of proofs that 
these values are equal. Unlike in conventional logic, Type Theory
allows us to talk about properties of proofs, e.g. we can not only ask 
the question whether two propositions (i.e. types) are logically
equivalent but also whether they are actually isomorphic
(i.e. computationally equivalent). Other components of Type Theory are
inductive and coinductive types which allow us to construct trees
with finite or potentially infinite depth and notion of a universe,
such as the universe of small sets corresponding to inaccessible
cardinals in set theory.

Many interesting questions in relation to Type Theory center around
the notion of equality. E.g. can we prove the principle of functional
extensionality, i.e. that two functions are equal if they are
pointwise equal? Maybe surprisingly, this principle is not provable in
Intensional Type Theory which is the basis of most implementations of
Type Theory (e.g. Agda, Coq). However, this shortcoming can be
addressed using Observational Type Theory which is one of the main
outcomes of EPSRC project XXX based on earlier work by Altenkirch
\cite{alti:lics99} . Another question related to equality is the
question whether any two proofs of equality are themselves equal
(uniqueness of equality proofs)? It was shown by Hofmann and Streicher
that this is not provable in standard Type Theory using a groupoid
interpretation of Type Theory \cite{groupoid-model}. Later Lumsdaine
and independently Garner and de Berg \cite{lumsdaine,garner-deberg}
showed that equality in Type Theory give rise to a weak
$\omega$-groupoid, a structure well known in higher-dimensional
category.

Voevodsky and Awodey developed an interpretation of Type Theory using
homotopy theory \cite{voevodsky,awodey}. In this interpretation types
are viewed as (special) topological spaces, elements as points and
equality proofs as paths or homotopies between elements. The homotopy
interpretation gives a very intuitive geometric explanation for the
unprovability of uniqueness of equality proofs. It also lead Voevodsky
to postulate the univalence axiom, which states that weakly equivalent
types should be equal. In particular isomorphic sets such as natural
numbers and lists of natural numbers are equated as a consequence of
the univalence axiom. Clearly, the univalence axiom is incompatible
with uniqueness of equality proofs since in general there is more than
one way to show that two isomorphic sets are equal. The univalence
axiom implies the principle of extensionality --- indeed it can be viewed
as a strong extensionality principle which identifies
indistinguishable types.  

Type Theory has an increasing influence on the development of
certified software and mathematical theories in particular through the
Coq system. While Coq in practice maintains a separation of logic and
proof, newer developments like the Agda system introduce Type Theory
as a total functional programming language with a particular
expressive type system and thus makes Type Theory accessible to
interested programmers. The availability of extensionality principles
(such as functional extensionality and univalence)
is here of practical importance because it is essential for an
structured development of a complex deliverables allowing us to 
replace one module by another, behaviourially equivalent one.
Unlike in conventional logic where it is enough just to postulate an
axiom this is not sufficient in Type Theory because this may stop
computation. Hence extensionality principles come with a canonicity
problem which need to be addressed before these principles can be used
in practice.

\section{Programme and Methodology}

In the research proposed here we are going to explore Univalent Type
Theory and in particular investigate its potential impact on Computer
Science in particular the efficient development of certified
software. Identifying equivalence of structures with equality raises
well known coherence issues which have been investigated in the
context of higher dimensional category theory \cite{eugenia} which
forms one of the foundations of our research (WP1). We conjecture that
this background is useful when developing Univalent Type Theory
addressing thorny issues such as the canonicity problem
\cite{harper,voevodsky,coquand} and the formulation of higher
dimensional quotients (WP2). The Agda system \cite{agda} which is at
the same time a programming language and a interactive proof system is
ideally suited to make these concepts available to interested
researchers. We will use the Agda system both as a tool to develop the
theory (WP3) but also as a target to turn theory into practice by developing
software tools based on Agda to support the use of Univalent Type
Theory for certification (WP4). Finally we plan to conduct a number of
case studies evaluating the potential impact of Univalent Type Theory
in Computer Science (WP5) and Computer Aided Mathematics (WP6).

Higher Dimensions for High Level Reasoning
From Homotopy Type Theory to Homotopy Programming Languages
Programming and Reasoning in 3d and higher dimensions
Programming and Reasoning in Homotopy Type Theory

- Advance of formal reasoning exploiting Type Theory, tools like Coq, Agda, etc
- Applications in Mathematics and Computer Science:
  - certified Maths
  - certified sw development
- Problem: High level structures as first class citizens, coherence issues
   Reusability
   In informal reasoning : issues are ignored
   E.g. consider groups up to group isomorphism
   However equivalences are not equalities in the conventional sense
- Proposed solution: Homotopy Type Theory
  - Voevodsky & Awodey
  - new foundations of mathematics
  - Model of Type Theory using Homotopy Theory
  - Sets are modelled as spaces, allows us to view equivalences as equality
  - corresponds to higher dimensions
- Theoretical aspects
  - Type theoretic foundations
  - using OTT to give a computational interpretation of univalence
  - relation to higher dimensional category theory (simplicial sets etc)
  - directed higher dimensional reasoning
- Exciting new connection between logic and geometry
- Relation To IR project, formalizing w-Groupoids
- Development:
  case studies:
       use HTT for structuring mathematical theories
       implement quotient containers using higher dimensional quotients
       use HTT to structure certified libraries for datatypes
       formally develop Ondrej's distributive laws
   language development:       
       develop a homotopy agda (agda in 3d)
       collaborate with the development at IAS (math verification -> certified progrm development)
       epigram (2d OTT), 
       Homotopic levitation ???
- Rypacek found exciting applications of higher dimensional in programming language theory
   (distributive laws).

{\bf \Large Part 1A: Previous Research \& Track Record}

\textbf{Professor Neil Ghani.} Neil Ghani earned his PhD in Computer
Science in 1995 from the University of Edinburgh, where he worked on
categorical models of rewriting.  After becoming a Lecturer at
Leicester and then a Reader at Nottingham he was appointed to a
professorship at the University of Strathclyde where he founded the
Mathematically Structured Programming (MSP) group. His research has
focussed on a number of topics directly related to the subject of the
current proposal, \eg (1) his work on data types (containers, quotient
containers, indexed containers and induction recursion) is directly
related to our plans in WP3 to develop the theory of higher inductive
types; (2) his work on logical relations is directly related to our
plans in WP1 and WP2 to develop the model theory for HoTT as well as
the syntactic presentation of this model theory as a type theory; (3)
his work on the semantics of effects is directly related to the
application of HoTT to effects as planned in WP4; and (4) his work on
Units of Measure (via an IAA grant held in collaboration with
Microsoft) directly relates to WP8 which applies HoTT to computing
with algebraic structures such as within Units of Measure. Indeed,
results obtained during his previous EPSRC grants on Containers,
Induction Recursion and Logical Relations will feed into this
proposal.  More generally, Neil Ghani is a world expert on the use of
semantic structures to drive the development of type theory and
programming languages, exactly the methodology to be followed in this
proposal.

Professor Ghani serves as a member of the EPSRC College charged with
assessing the quality of grant applications. He is also a grant
assessor for the Carnegie Trust.  He was the director of the Midlands
Graduate School in the Foundations of Computer Science, is a SICSA
theme leader in Complex Systems Engineering, and was on the Steering
Committee for the British Colloquium on Theoretical Computer Science.
He has served on numerous programme committees and been the external
examiner for a number of PhD students. He is also Deputy Head of
Department and Head of Research in his home Department. He has
successfully supervised five PhD students and four RAs and has
experience in the successful management of large grants. He organises
the Scot Cats seminar series, and plans to host a meeting in the UK on
Homotopy Type Theory in November 2014, both of which puts him in touch
with other experts in the area.

For further information, see~\url{http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/~ng}

\textbf{Dr Conor McBride.} Conor McBride received his PhD from the
University of Edinburgh in 1999 for his work on dependently typed
programming. After this, he worked as an RA at the Universities of
Durham and Nottingham before becoming a lecturer at the University of
Strathclyde in 2008. His work on the foundations and implementations
of non-dependently and dependently typed programming as become very
influential, both via his own programming language Epigram and via his
work with the Agda, Coq and Haskell teams. He is now widely regarded
as a leader of his field as illustrated by his widely cited papers,
journals, and invitations to keynote addresses at conferences
etc. Apart from the evident importance of this expertise for WP6 and
WP7, Dr McBride's work on OTT, on containers and on effects feed into
WPs 3 and 4. Since becoming a lecturer, Dr McBride has had two grants
funded by EPSRC and - importantly - one by Microsoft. Not only are all
of these grants of direct relevance to this project, but these grants
show both his experience of working in large distributed grants and
that our plans for generating industrial impact through collaborations
with Microsoft are built on solid and successful pre-existing
foundations. Dr McBride has also supervised two PhD students and
currently supervises a further two students. He also leads the MSP
group.

For further information,
see~\url{https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/}

\textbf{Host Institution: The University of Strathclyde.} The MSP
group at the University of Strathclyde is an ideal venue for
conducting this research. Led by Conor McBride, the group includes
Prof Ghani, Dr Clemens Kupke, Dr Ross Duncan as well as two research
associates and seven PhD students. The MSP groups vision is to use
mathematics to understand the nature of computation, and to turn that
understanding into the next generation of programming languages. That
is exactly the methodology used within this proposal and hence this
proposal will both benefit from, and benefit, the MSP group.
Finally, central Scotland is home to vibrant theoretical computer
science and functional programming research communities, and the
University of Strathclyde is an active participant in the Scottish
Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA). The MSP group also
is active in other Scottish meetings, such as ScotCats and SPLS.

\textbf{Dr Thorsten Altenkirch.}  Thorsten Altenkirch received his PhD in
Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh in 1993. Since 2006
he is Reader at the University of Nottingham,
where he founded the Functional Programming Laboratory with Graham
Hutton in 2008. Altenkirch is well known for his work on type theory
and applications of category theory in computer science, and has
published over 50 research papers which are frequently cited (h-index~$\geq 26$). During his
work at Nottingham he attracted \pounds 1M in research funding,
comprising~\pounds650,903 as PI in 4 EPSRC grants, \pounds241,075 as
CoI in 2 EPSRC grants, \pounds159,038 in 1 fellowship and 1
studentship. Especially relevant for the current project is
Observational Equality For Dependently Typed Programming
(EP/C512022/1), Theory And Applications of Induction Recursion
(EP/G03298X/1), Reusability and Dependent Types
(EP/G034109/1). Altenkirch and Ghani have already collaborated
successfully on three research grants. More generally, 
Altenkirch is one of the leading researchers on HoTT
This is witnessed by his fellowship at the Institute of Advanced Study
in Princeton in occasion of the special year on the subject in 2013. There, he contributed to the standard reference on the
subject~\cite{hott-book}.  He has given invited lectures on the
subject (at HDACT in Lubljana in 2012, at the Curien-fest in Venice in
2013, at MSC in Lyon and at the Institut Henri Poincar\'e in Paris in
2014). He has already published several papers on HoTT
\cite{altenkirch:extSetoids,alti:ott-conf,alti:csl12,alti:tlca13-hedberg}.

\textbf{Host institution: The University of Nottingham.}  The
University of Nottingham is a leading UK University 
and its School of Computer Science was ranked 8th in the last Research
Assessment Exercise. The Functional Programming Lab (FP Lab) within the School
is one of its four major research groups, with an international
reputation for its work on formally-based approaches to software
construction and verification.  The FP Lab currently comprises 4
academic staff: Professor Graham Hutton, Dr Thorsten Altenkirch, Dr
Venanzio Capretta, and Dr Henrik Nilsson and nine PhD students.  To
date, the group has received~\pounds1.5M of EPSRC funding over 14
projects, and has 12 completed PhD students.  The FP Lab provides a highly stimulating research environment,
holds weekly research seminars and is also a leading participant in the MGS - a
collaborative venture with Leicester and Birmingham offering training
to PhD students.

Computer Science from the University of Manchester in 2002. After
carrying out postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge and the
Universit\'e du Qu\'ebec \`a Montr\'eal, he was appointed to an Assistant Professorship
in Mathematical Logic at the University of Palermo in 2008. Since
 2012, he is an Associate Professor in Pure Mathematics at
the University of Leeds. Nicola Gambino has a consistent record of

international conferences, {e.g.}~at the 2010 Logic Colloquium in Paris
and at the forthcoming joint 2014 RTA-TLCA conference in Vienna. He
held visiting positions at several prestigeous research centres, including the Institut Mittag-Leffler (Stockholm), the
Fields Institute (Toronto) and the Institute of Advanced Study
(Princeton), where he worked in contact with Vladimir Voevodsky (the inventor of 
the Univalence Axiom).  He is currently an invited researcher to the
Institut Henri Poincar\'e (Paris) for the special trimester on
Semantics of Proofs and Certified Mathematics.  He is an editor of the
journal Mathematical Structures in Computer Science. He has been funded by 
EPSRC via a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Mathematics (GR/R95975/01), held at the University of Cambridge. He is currently PI on a grant from 
the US Air Force Office for Scientific
Research, which is funding an RA working on the relation between HoTT and
higher-dimensional category theory. 
Nicola Gambino is one of the leading researchers on HoTT; in particular, in collaboration with Richard Garner, he obtained~\cite{gambinoGarner:ITwfs} one of the 
very first results relating type theory and homotopy theory. His work in HoTT, \eg \cite{awodeyGamSoja:indTypesInHTT}, builds on his combination of expertise in type theory~\cite{GambinoN:gentti}, category 
theory~\cite{gambinoHyland:welfoundedTrees,GambinoN:polfpm} and homotopical algebra~\cite{GambinoN:homl2c,GambinoN:weilsh}.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\vspace*{-0.1in}

{\bf Formal Verification.} The cost of software failure is truly
staggering\footnote{see the section on National
  Importance.}. Traditional methods of software verification based
upon testing only generate partial guarantees of correctness and
although stronger
guarantees of software correctness can be given by mathematical
proofs, the complexity of modern software means that hand written
mathematical proofs are untrustworthy. As a result, the only way to
ensure truly secure and reliable software is the gold standard of
formally verified software, which offers machine-checked mathematical
proofs of software correctness. Several decades of pioneering work in
the UK and elsewhere has culminated in systems 
such as Agda, Coq, Epigram, Idris, NuPRL, Twelf, and
the Trellys project which are now having significant impact,
\eg Coq has won both the 2013 ACM Software award and the 2013 SIGPLAN
Programming Languages Software award. The advanced type-theoretic
technology of these systems is also raided by more mainstream languages
with significant industrial deployment such as Haskell, OCaml, Scala
and C\#.

{\bf The Project.} Despite their success, such systems have several
fundamental limitations, \eg when programming with quotients,
supporting abstraction (that is, invariance under different
representations of the same structure) and extensional reasoning
(proving that programs which behave the same are the same).  {\em
  Homotopy Type Theory} (HoTT) is widely regarded as a fundamental
innovation with great potential to address these and other problems.
To realise this potential, we propose a synthesis of
theoretical, applied and impact-focussed research.


%Delivering this potential requires i) further development of the
%foundations of HoTT; ii) programming language and verification tools
%based on these foundations; and iii) applications demonstrating their
%effectiveness to the broader community.  Therefore we i
%The key concept in HoTT is to introduce a very liberal
%equality which identifies structures that are replacable.

%Its core is Voevodsky's {\em Univalence Axiom} asserting
%that all provable equalities can be internalised as paths or, more
%conceptually, that computation is invariant under change of
%representation of the entities we compute with.


$\;\;\; \;\;\;$ {\em Theoretical Foundations.} Almost all of our
understanding of HoTT exists within a classical framework and hence
cannot be used to develop programming language and verification
tools. However, the recent cubical sets model by Coquand
et.al.~\cite{BezemM:cubsmt} is constructive and thus strongly suggests
that HoTT has a
purely constructive presentation. We will will develop
both specific constructive models and a general constructive model
theory of HoTT, and then complement these models with type theoretic
presentations of them.

$\;\;\;\;\;\;$ {\em Programming Language and Verification Tools.} The key
  deliverable of the second strand of our research is a HoTT-based
  programming language which simultaneously acts as a verification
  environment. We aim at a major
  and transformational step forward in programming languages design
  which will influence
  the development of all current and future systems in this area.

$\;\;\;\;\;\;$ {\em Generating Impact.} Developing new and fundamentally
  better ways to construct formally verified software is not just an
  end in itself, but is also a key prerequisite for engaging others to
  do the same.  To ensure this, we will produce a number of case studies so
  users can learn from, and experiment with, our results. Their
  practical experiences will also feed back into our research.

  {\bf Calibre, Ambition, and Adventure.} HoTT's potential to
  solve one of the deepest and most fundamental problems in
  programming languages and verification - namely the efficient
  computational treatment of equality/representational invariance -
  demonstrates our ambition to transform the field. The proposal's calibre is demonstrated by
  the depth and range of the state-of-the-art ideas deployed and by the
  stature of our collaborators. The
  proposal's adventure is demonstrated by its scope, ranging from
  fundamental research (WP1,2,3) to programming languages and
  verification (WP5,6,7) to impact generation via case studies
  (WP4,8).

\section{Scientific and Technological Background.}
\vspace*{-0.1in} 

{\bf Programming Languages.} Abstraction is essential in programming
as identifying common structure ensures code is clear,
clean and concise. This leads to high level
programming languages with expressive type systems capable of closing
the {\em semantic gap} between what programmers know about
computational entities and what their types can express about them.
The current state-of-the-art are the {\em dependently typed
  programming languages} mentioned above where
the type of a program can express a
continuum of precision - from basic assertions up to a complete
specification - about the program’s behaviour. This proposal will
develop the first of a new breed of 
such languages which advance the state-of-the-art by offering a
powerful yet computationally tractable equality, and thereby bring to
reality the goal of programming up to invariance of representation.

%Coq award

{\bf Program Verification.} While the advantages of the certainty
afforded by mathematical proof has been recognised for centuries, it
has also been recognised that this certainty is undermined by the
capacity for humans to make mistakes in their proofs. The advent of
computers raised the possibility once more of achieving in practice
the promise of mathematical certainty. This potential is now coming to
fruition, \eg systems such as Coq have been able to formally verify
both large mathematical theorems such as the 4-Colour problem, and
large software systems such as the CompCert C-compiler. However, these
systems are not {\em extensional} as objects which are behaviourally
indistinguishable cannot be proven the same and this fundamental problem
significantly weakens the power of the verification system. In contrast, our
research will produce a formal verification system where objects
with the same behaviour can indeed be proved equal.


{\bf Type Theory.} Underlying formal verification systems and
programming languages is the subject of type theory. A key idea is the
Curry-Howard correspondence asserting that programs and proofs
are actually the same thing, \eg proofs are just particular forms of
programs. By developing sophisticated type theories, we
thus advance both the fields of programming languages and program
verification. Another major advance was Martin-L\"of's realisation
that type theory needed to be extended to cover equality within the
system. %This produced a sophisticated theory because not only could
%one talk about proofs of the equality of terms, but also proofs that
%such proofs were in fact the same.
To do this, he introduced extensional Matin-L\"of Type Theory which, while
producing a strong notion of equality, had the fundmaental flaw
that type checking became undecidable. He therefore 
introduced intensional Martin-L\"of Type Theory (MLTT) but its
equality proved to be too weak, \eg pointwise equal functions 
cannot be proven equal. Finding a strong yet computationally tractable equality has remained
unresolved for 40 years - HoTT is exciting precisely because
it seems to offer a solution to this most fundamental of problems. 


{\bf Observational Type Theory and Logical Relations:} (OTT) was
proposed by Altenkirch and McBride~\cite{alti:ott-conf} as a step
towards such a stronger equality. Unlike the equality type of MLTT which
defined equality uniformly for all types, OTT defines equality by
induction on the structure of types (and is thus extensional) while
its definitional equality remains decidable. However, the {\em
  equality of types} themselves is rigidly structural which means it
is not strong enough to convert proofs about one type to proofs about
an equivalent type. As HoTT can be seen as a proof-relevant
extension of OTT, our experience in OTT will be invaluable throughout
the project. Another important background technology is logical
relations which again uses induction on type structure to define not
equlities, but rather relations, over all types. Logical relations
have already been used~\cite{LicataHarper} to study a truncated form
of HoTT. Further, the cubical sets model~\cite{BezemM:cubsmt} is
closely related to logical relations as cubical sets arise naturally
when one extends logical relations to higher dimensions via the
pattern of set, relation, relation between relations etc. Ghani's
EPSRC funded research into logical relations will be used to inject
advanced logical relations techniques - eg higher dimensional logical
relations - into all areas of the project.

% hott = tt + univalence + hits

% hott = int param + kan filllers + hits
% what does univalence mean

{\bf Homotopy Type Theory.} HoTT is a revolutionary new analysis of
type theory based on intuitions from homotopy theory. Types are
\emph{spaces}; terms are \emph{elements} within a space; the equality
type is the space of \emph{paths} in a space and such paths contain
non-trivial structural information and thus generate a proof-relevant
equality which enables one to program and reason up to invariance of
representation. The core of HoTT is the new Axiom of Univalence,
introduced by Fields medalist Vladimir Voevodsky, asserting (roughly)
that isomorphic types are equal. HoTT subsumes function extensionality
but also transcends what we could previously express, e.g.\
\emph{higher} inductive types (HITs) include the usual tree-like data
types, but also include quotients \cite{alti:mpc04} and geometric
objects such as the circle and sphere. HITs also occur in computer
science, e.g. lists are an inductive type; braids are lists with extra
paths identifying lists up to twisting of any element past its
neighbours, and bags are braids with paths-between-paths identifying
braidings which yield the same permutation. The recent cubical sets
model of HoTT~\cite{BezemM:cubsmt} interprets closed expressions of
HoTT within the model which proves the basic feasibility of computing
with the Univalence Axiom. However, much work lies ahead: we need to
interpret closed expressions not just within the model, but also as
normal forms \emph{within} HoTT itself. We need to recover
definitional equalities lost by the cubical interpretation (such as
the computation rule for equality types). Further, other models may
offer better computational foundations for HoTT, so practical progress
towards HoTT-based programming languages and verification tools needs
the broader model theory we propose.



%txa: replacing
% One of the key features of Coquand's model is that
% the equality relation is defined recursively over the structure of
% types using an internalised form of parametricity. 




% Nevertheless, Coquand's and Huber's
%work shows that producing programming languages and proof assistants
%based upon HoTT is feasible in principle and we plan to
%collaborate closely with them.

{\bf WP1: Semantic Foundations of HoTT.}  We seek semantic insights
for HoTT akin to those provided by Cartesian closed categories for
the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus.  A proper model theory for
HoTT is essential because i) a general model theory 
guides the design of different presentations and implementations of
HoTT; ii) models of HoTT provide algebraic techniques to reason
about the correctness of implementations which complement syntactic
techniques; and iii) specific implementations of HoTT can
be proven sound by giving a specific models of them.  These models
need to be constructive so that programs, even those using the
Univalence axiom, will compute ({i.e.} reduce to a normal form). 
%While
%the standard model of HoTT based upon simplicial sets is not
%constructive, the cubical sets model currently being developed~\cite{BezemM:cubsmt} is constructive and raises the question of understanding it
%within a general model theory.

We propose to: i) analyse existing models ({e.g.}
groupoids~\cite{HofmannM:groitt}, strict
$\omega$-groupoids~\cite{WarrenM:strgit}, simplicial
sets~\cite{KapulkinC:simmuv}, cubical sets~\cite{BezemM:cubsmt}) and
isolate exactly how they ensure constructivity or where they fail to
do so - in the latter case, we will attempt to constructivize them;
ii) building on this, we will develop a general model theory for HoTT
by isolating the essential features of these models and by adapting
known methods to construct Quillen model structures to the setting of
HoTT ({c.f.}~\cite{ShulmanM:uniidh}, which however does not cover the
cubical sets model).  Our starting point will be recent advances in
axiomatizing the notion of a model of type theory
({e.g..}~\cite{AwodeyS:natmtt}) - will will then require the existence
of additional structure corresponding to the axioms of HoTT. In terms
of risk, i) is certainly achievable since it involves only the
analysis of existing concrete models, while ii) is our more ambitious
goal. Nevertheless, our expertise on semantics of type
theories~\cite{neil2014relParamDep}, homotopical
algebra~\cite{GambinoN:homl2c,GambinoN:weilsh} and
$\omega$-groupoids~\cite{alti:csl12} makes even this ambitious goal
feasible. {\em Deliverables: A broad collection of models of HoTT
  which map out the design space of its syntactic
  presentations. Collaborator: Prof Steve Awodey}

% has thus opened the door to a more general model theory.

% %Joyal
% %Back ground : Qullien model structures

% We will attack this problem from the following directions: i) we will
% analyse existing models (cubical sets, groupoids, strict
% $\omega$-groupoids, simplicial sets, globular sets) to isolate exactly
% how they ensure constructivity, or (where they fail to do so) how to 
% constructivize them; and ii) informed by i),
% we will develop a model theory for HoTT by both adapting known methods to
% define Quillen model structures (such as the small object argument)
% to the constructive setting and by showing how one can build  new
% constructive model structures from old (\eg by
% slicing). A promising starting point for a constructive
% version of the small object argument comes from Garner's work, where
% it is related to the construction of free monads. In terms of risk,
% i) is certainly achievable since it involves only the analysis of
% existing concrete models, while ii) is a more ambitious
% goal. Nevertheless, our expertise on semantic models of parametricity \cite{neil2014relParamDep}, model
% categories (Gambino) and $\omega$-groupoids \cite{alti:csl12} makes even this
% ambitious goal feasible. Deliverables from WP1 will be a broad class
% of models of HoTT which considerably deepen our
% understanding and map out the design space of its 
% syntactic presentations.

{\bf WP2: Univalent Type Theory.} Building on WP1, we need syntactic
presentations of our models of HoTT in the form of type theories. The
challenge is to present the essential data of the model as built from
a {\em finite} collection of type and term constructors - this is
particularly intricate given the {\em arbitrary} higher dimensional
structure of HoTT. One also must prove essential properties such as strong normalisation, decidability of
definitional equality and canonicity (i.e. all terms reduce to
values). It is of particular interest to establish the expressive
power of the associated equational theories, e.g. to distinguish
carefully between which computation rules hold as definitional
equalities and which as propositional equalities. Another key property
(required for WP5) is that, as a foundational theory, our type theory
ought to be expressive enough to describe its own models. These
properties will be established either directly or via the models of
WP1.




%Different models will produce different theories and we
%will analyse them in terms of their tractablility, concision and 
%meta-theoretic properties. Essential properties we require of a well
%behaved type theory are

% We will begin by developing Altenkirch's preliminary type theory for
% cubical sets, which both internalises parametricity and adds Kan
% fillers to the theory. 
We will build on Altenkirch's observation that cubical sets share
many similarities with logical relations by replacing the uniform
identity type of intensional MLTT with a higher-dimensional equality
defined to fit the structure of types. The models from WP1 will drive
refinement of our design, until we have a canonical presentation of
HoTT. Our preparatory work, and prior expertise in OTT
\cite{alti:ott-conf}, normalisation by evaluation and big-step
reduction \cite{alti:ctcs95,alti:lics96,alti:flops04,txa:jtait},
strengthening definitional
equality~\cite{Allais:2013:NEN:2502409.2502411}, and logical
relations~\cite{neil2014relParamDep} ensures a high probability of
delivering an effective presentation of HoTT.  {\em Deliverable: A
  type theory for HoTT. Collaborator: Prof Thierry Coquand.}

%We follow the
%practise in WP1 of managing risk in this workpackage by first aiming
%at the moderate goal of deriving specific presentations relating to
%specific models and then aiming for the more ambitious goal of
%integrating these presentations onto a unified framework.

{\bf WP3: Higher Inductive Types.} Our goal is to accomodate HITs in
the semantics developed in WP1 and the syntactic framework of WP2. To
achieve this, we will first develop a universal HIT playing the role for
HITs that W-types play for ordinary inductive
types~\cite{alti:icalp04}. This is feasible as partial progress has
already been made: one can reduce HITs with higher dimensional
constructors to HITs with only 0- and 1-dimensional ones (using the
\emph{hub-and-spokes} construction~\cite{hott-book}).
%fnf: is it counterproductive to cite the HoTT book here?
Similarly, preliminary results suggest that quotient
containers~\cite{abottAltenGhaniMcB:quotientContainers} can be reduced
to ordinary containers in a homotopical setting 
%fnf: weak sentence below
(using ideas of Gylterud~\cite{gylterud:thesis} and
Kock~\cite{kock:groupoids}).
%
A secondary goal is to generate a high-level syntax for HITs as
an alternative to the universal HIT in the same way that strictly
positive types provide a grammar for defining various
W-types~\cite{alti:cont-tcs,alti:jcats07}.  This will feed into WP7.
More ambitiously, we will %-- time permitting --
investigate extensions such as coinductive HITs, mixed
inductive/coinductive HITs \cite{txa:mpc2010g}, and
inductive-inductive~\cite{fnf:indind} and
inductive-recursive~\cite{DS:indrec} HITs. The latter will be useful
in WP5, since it makes a more concise representation of dependently
typed syntax~\cite{chapman2009type} possible by introducing
constructors and the representation of definitional equality at the
same time.
%%fnf: the following is mentioned in WP7, and might fit better there:
%We will also investigate a pattern matching syntax for HITs; this is
%related again to WP7.
Our work on data
types~\cite{alti:cont-tcs,alti:lics09,txa:cie10,alti:catind2,ghani:fibredIR,gambinoHyland:welfoundedTrees,awodeyGamSoja:indTypesInHTT},
including our EPSRC grants on containers and induction-recursion, means
our first and second goals
are relatively risk-free,
especially since partial results already exist, 
% These show that results are available, and will also guide the way
% towards further results.
while progress on our more ambitious goal 
is not essential to the rest of the project. {\em Deliverable: A
  theory of HITs that is both foundational, and will underpin the
  programming language developed in WP6 and WP7. Collaborator: Prof
  Mike Schulman. }

{\bf WP4: Impact I - Programming with Effects.}
Most programs interact with their environments,
but such \emph{effectful} programs are known to be inherently difficult to
reason about.
Major advances were Moggi's~\cite{moggi:monad} realisation that effects can be modelled semantically by monads, and
% and Wadler later
%showed that monads could internalised as syntactic sugar to structure
%effectful programs themselves, \eg via the {\tt do}-notation of
%Haskell. More recently, 
Plotkin and Power's~\cite{PlotkinPower:Lawvere} proof that (almost
all) computational monads arise from Lawvere Theories, i.e.\ can be
presented as effect-generating operations and equations.
Unfortunately, in general, equational theories cannot be represented
in current programming languages such as Haskell, and one is usually 
forced to program not using the quotient algebra as desired, but
using the free algebra and then check -- externally to the program --
that the quotient structure is respected.  

With HITs, there is no need for such a convoluted process!
as one
can program directly on the quotient algebra,
assert the correctness of the program within its type, and thereby 
efficiently formally verify the program's correctness. Concretley, we will formalise both Lawvere
Theories (using HITs to represent effectful computations) and their
mathematical algebra (e.g.\ tensor products, sums) in HoTT.  This will
both simplify and extend i) McBride, Andjelkovic and Lindley's effect
handlers in Frank~\cite{conor:frank}; ii) Brady's effects library for
Idris~\cite{brady:effects}; and iii) Bauer and Pretnar's treatment of
effects in Eff~\cite{bauer:eff}.  This will be done within the type
theory of WP2, and progress will be reflected into the programming
language of WP7. This will both validate the theoretical research done
by RA1, and also generate impact by showing how HoTT can transform a
major programming languages topic. Basic results are low risk as,
conceptually, we simply need to stitch together the treatment of
quotients via HITs with that of effects via Lawvere theories.
However, more advanced effects (\eg indexed effects) or the full-scale
integration of our results into WP7 will be more challenging. {\em
  Deliverable: A treatment of Lawvere Theories within
  HoTT. Collaborator: Dr Nick Benton.}


{\bf WP5 Formalisation of Meta-Theory of HoTT.}  As we intend to use
HoTT as a formal verification system, we need the highest possible
level of trust in its correctness. Indeed, the complexity of HoTT's
semantics due to its higher dimensional nature, make a paper based
verification almost unfeasible and certainly not trustworthy --- this
issue was pointed out by Voevodsky recently \cite{voevodsky-ias14}.

As a starting point we will formalize the existing model theory
(e.g. the cubical sets model) in conventional Type Theory using Agda
--- this accompanies WP1. When moving on to the more syntactic
approach of WP2 we plan to exploit HITs to achieve a feasible
formalisation of dependently typed syntax. While initially working
with an axiomatic approach to HoTT (i.e. adding univalence and HITs as
postulates) we plan to exploit the results of WPs 6 and 7
in later stages of the project, enabling at least a partial self
certification of HoTT in HoTT.  While this approach seems unsound at
the first glance it is reasonable since it is unlikely that a bug in
the theory leads to an unsound formalisation of the metatheory.  Not
only will WP5 ensure the required level of trust in our system, but it
will have a significant impact upon the formal verification community
as it will be the first instance of formal verification in a {\em
  HoTT-based} formal verification environment. {\em Deliverable:
  Formally verified proofs of the key properties of
  HoTT. Collaborator: Vladimir Voevodsky}


{\bf WP6: Implementing a Core Programming Language.} In order to showcase
the potential for HoTT based programming languages to the wider
programming languages community, and learn from their feedback, we
need to build a prototypical implementation of a type checker and
interpreter based on the type theory designed in WP2.  This system
forms a proof of concept implementation lacking most of the bells
and whistles present in modern implementations of Type Theory. That
is, while we will implement the type theory of WP2, we will not
attempt to implement a high-level syntax for datatypes, universe
polymorphism, implicit arguments or pattern matching. However, we plan
to incorporate the results from WP3 to support a generic version of
HITs.

We will use Haskell as an implementation language because
there is considerable expertise at Nottingham and Strathclyde in using
Haskell to implement type checkers for dependently typed languages
including Epigram, $\Pi\Sigma$ and Agda
\cite{alti:checking,easy,alti:pisigma-new}.  In addition, our
prototypical implementation of OTT will be particularly informative as
it can be viewed as a precursor of HoTT as it has a recursively
defined notion of equality. Another source of inspiration comes from
logical relations
here there is considerable experience at Strathclyde.
We will collaborate with people at
Chalmers, especially building on Coquand and Huber's experiences with
implementing the cubical sets model - which also shows that our
approach is feasible in principle. {\em Deliverable: A simple
  HoTT-based programminmg language. Collaborator: Mattieu Sozeau}

% Coquand's and Huber's implementation of the cubical set model shows
% that our approach is feasible in principle and we plan to collaborate
% with them. However, we should be able to address particular issues
% such as the fact that certain definitional equalities don't hold in
% the cubical set model using the technology we have developed in the
% context of OTT \cite{alti:ott-conf} which is the subject of current
% work at Strathclyde.

% The main difficulty within this WP is that the implementation of
% higher dimensional type theories is a new area --- nevertheless our
% experience in the implementation of dependent type theories leads us
% to believe this is still of low risk. Having said that, there is some
% risk that the implementation takes much longer than expected: we will
% manage this by keeping the scope of the language small. {\bf Play up OTT and Parametricity (Johann)}

{\bf WP7: A High Level Programming Language.} We will make the
language developed in WP6 more usable by adding a high-level syntax
for datatypes including higher inductive types, by integrating known
technology such as implicit arguments, and by adding compilation and
interfaces to other languages. An important question is wether it is
possible to integrate our approach to HoTT with existing systems such
as Agda or Coq, or wether it is preferable to start from scratch. We
will explore both options in close collaboration with Coq developers
(e.g. Hugo Herbelin, Matthieu Sozeau) and Agda developers (Andreas
Abel, Ulf Norrell). The technical challenges we face are to restrict pattern matching so
that it is compatible with HoTT --- we plan to build on recent work
by Coeckx \cite{coeckx-without-k}. There are other issues
related to the termination checker which need to be adressed, 
see recent discussions on the Agda and Coq mailing lists.
%\cite{coq-agda-issue-w-termination}. 
We also would like to integrate pattern
matching with HITs --- this is currently an open problem. 
{\em Deliverable: Collaborator: Edwin Brady}



 % A central question which needs to be
% answered is wether it is preferable to integrate our ideas with an
% existing system such as Agda, Coq or Idris or wether it is preferable
% to start from scratch. The advantages of the former approach is that
% we connect with significant user communities, can learn from their
% experience and avoid duplication of work. However, it is currently
% not clear wether this is feasible since it would affect the very
% core of these systems. Either way, we plan to collaborate closely with
% the developers of these systems to maximise compatibility and impact.


% This is the most ambitious of our work packages because, if successful,
% we would have produced a new state of the art programming language for
% software construction and verification. Given the current interest in
% HoTT, it would immediately attract attention of significant
% numbers. However, the volume of work required to develop a practical
% language makes this also the most risky WP. Nevertheless, if all we
% produce are proof-of-concept implementations of some high level
% features, leaving significant amounts of the implementation of a
% practical language to future work, then the project as a whole will
% still be a massive success because both the foundational, practical
% and engineering groundwork for a homotopical programming language will
% have been done. {\bf Libraries for doing HoTT in Agda}


% In Agda pattern matching is one of the main devices to support
% efective program construction ofr depndent types. However, unlimited
% pattern matching is incompatible with HoTT. Currently, in Akgda there
% is an adhoc implementation of a check that pattern matching is
% restricted so that UIP is not derivable. However, there is no clear
% theory or justification of the current implementation which also has
% been proven to be unsound in several instances. Our goal is to develop
% a notion of pattern matching which is consistent with HoTT and
% formally verify this fact. 

% In HoTT there are two orthogonal hierarchies of types indexed by size
% (i.e. universe level) and dimension (i.e. truncation level or h-level). We often
% want to quantify over types with a certain size or a certain dimension
% and we also want to be able to implement construction parametric in
% both. On the other hand we want to minimize bureaucracy and in
% particular automatically infer subtyping relations bewteen different
% levels. We will explore this new area which is essential to make HoTT
% usable in practice.



{\bf WP8: Impact II - Programming and Invariance.} The ultimate goal
of the proposed research is to support software construction and
verification via HoTT. Our final work package comes full circle to our
original motivation: we will apply our programming language to a
number of real-world programming problem. By abstracting recurring and effective
patterns that arise, we will also take the first steps in moving from
programming with HoTT to software enginerering with HoTT! See {\em
  Pathways to Impact}. {\em Deliverable: ,Collaborator: Dr A Kennedy} 

%Firstly, HoTT's ability to ``work up to isomorphism'' opens the way to
%program correctly using simple and straightforward reference
%presentations of data structures and then replace these presentations
%with more efficient equivalents at runtime. For instance, we shall
%deliver treatments of \emph{numbers} (simple unary representations $\cong$
%efficient binary representations), \emph{sequences} (cons-lists $\cong$
%inger-trees) and \emph{matrices} (vector-of-vectors $\cong$ sparse
%encodings). More generally, this opens the way for HoTT technology to
%be applied to situations where methodologies such as {\em views} and
%{\em worker-wrapper transformations} thereby influencing their
%development too. 
%A similar phenomenon occurs with data structures which store redundant
%information to improve access time, e.g., databases with indices to
%cut search, and records with cached values to avoid
%recomputation. {\bf ornaments}. The technical challenge will be to
%ensure that the efficiency savings are not dominated by the cost of
%computing with isomorphisms at runtime. Our idea is to use fusion to
%minimise the number of isomorphisms present at runtime, and to enable
%the compiler to work with intermediate representations to give fine
%grain control of the cost of the isomorphisms involved.  This will
%ensure that we maximize the regions within which we use the efficient
%representations, converting data only at the boundaries.  In effect,
%we will have improved on \emph{data abstraction}, the state-of-the-art
%tool for managing the craft of implementation, by supporting the
%refinement of concrete computational models of data.
%
%Secondly, HoTT's richer notion of equality ensures that different
%representations of a value can be exploited for efficiency purposes
%but cannot yield inconsistency. For example, whilst treelike
%structures can be given a canonical form, data such as individual graphs, cycles
%and multisets often have multiple representatives which should be
%treated the same by operations. Today's technology presents the
%dilemma of whether to expose the representation and risk inconsistent
%treatment or to hide behind an abstraction barrier which offers a
%fixed repertoire of consistent operations but inhibits us from
%exploiting the representation to develop unforeseen operations
%efficiently. At last HoTT offers us a precise deal: we can work with
%representatives, but we must work up to equality.

\section{Quality, Management, and Planning}

\vspace*{-0.1in}


{\bf Relevance to Beneficiaries.} We have already discussed the
calibre, ambition, and adventure inherent in recasting the foundations
of programming languages within the 
introduction. As a result, our research has the potential to have a
very significant impact over the long run: while theoretical computer
scientists will of course be interested in the fundamental nature of
HoTT, the most significant long term impact will be on those who
program and those who verify programs. Many of these researchers are
already intrigued by the potential of HoTT and our plan is to answer
their needs by generating
exactly the critical mass of examples of code and verification that
will provide them with a gateway into HoTT. See {\em Patheways to
  Impact} for details.


\noindent {\bf Timeliness and Novelty.} This research is extremely timely:
in addition to our own results, there have been ground-breaking
recent advances in HoTT, \eg the constructive cubical sets model. Moreover, the
US government has just funded a \$7.5m complementary project applying
HoTT to the foundations of mathematics, thereby further increasing
timeliness. As for novelty, our goal of turning cutting-edge
developments in type theory into state-of-the-art programming language
and verification techniques distinguishes our approach to HoTT from
many others which typically focus on one or the other. We make this
our goal as we believe that severing the link between foundational
understanding and practical application diminishes both. This overall
novelty is complemented at a more detailed level by the novelty of our
background in logical relations, containers, and OTT. This is crucial
... while we benefit from being part of the worldwide HoTT community,
we also have great distinctiveness in our cumulative
competencies, experiences, and hence approach.
 
%\vspace*{0.02in}

{\bf Nationally Importance.} The software market is estimated at
$\pounds 300$ billion per year, and this will grow significantly in
real terms as software becomes ever more ubiquitous. It's thus
essential to the UK's national interest to have strong presence in
this market. One crucial aspect of software is that it is correct,
i.e., does what's intended and does not go wrong.  While failures of
everyday devices like iPods and mobile phones are inconvenient,
software leaking voting records or compromising the global financial
sector can lead to unprecedented and clearly unacceptable global
uncertainties. Indeed, as remarked earlier, the cost of software failure is
truly staggering!  Therefore the
demand for provably correct software is likely to grow significantly because testing inherently
offers only partial guarantees of correctness, and because
programming language technology is finally advancing to the stage
where it is feasible to formally verify critical programs.  EPSRC
also recognises that programming languages and program verification are
areas of vital national importance deserving increased funding and
this proposal lies squarely in the intersection of these areas. Within
these areas, we are aiming high.  The current state of the art in
programming language design is limited by a 40 year lack of a clear
understanding of how to treat equality within a programming language -
our step change will replace current ad-hoc and limited
treatments with a powerful one based upon solid foundations. Thus our
research is expected to have great impact 
over the next 10 to 50 years by becoming the
cornerstone for the next generation of high level programming and
verification environments.

%\vspace*{0.02in}

{\bf Feasibility and Success Critieria.} We are {\em exceptionally
  well-positioned} to conduct the proposed research: Drs Gambino and
Altenkirch both attended the Special Year on HoTT in Princeton, have
published influential papers on HoTT, as well as coauthoring the HoTT
book~\cite{hott-book}. Prof Ghani is an expert on logical relations
and Dr McBride is a world leader in programming languages - see the
{\em Justification of Resources} for more details on our
comptenancies. Overall a significant positive outcome is very
realistic, as evidenced by our ideas and insights which we have sanity
checked and by other ground-breaking recent advances in HoTT
~\cite{ShulmanM:uniidh,BezemM:cubsmt}. If any
difficulty arises, we will supplement our experience with that of our
collaborators and the highly active HoTT community. Success criteria
for each work package are given as clearly delineated deliverables -
we have argued why these deliverables are of great value individually
but also are essential to the overall goal of the project. The success
criteria for the overall project are i) new syntactic and semantic
foundations for HoTT; ii) programming language and verification tools
for computing with HoTT; and iii) a code base of programs written in,
and verified by, these tools which show applied researchers how HoTT
aids their daily practice.

%40 years open => 40 years importance.

{\bf Planning, Collaboration and Management:} Apart from clearly
planning the content, methodology and success criteria of each work package, and the inherent balance between risk and ambition
within them, we have also minimised risk {\em between} work packages
by ensuring the deliverables are relatively low-risk and
enable the project to proceed even if the
more ambitious goals are unattainable. We have also carefully planned how the work
packages interact, who will lead them and who will be secondary
contributors - see the Gantt chart. The biggest risk is the huge
amount of {\em engineering} work required by a programming language
and verification tools - we have thus separated the ambitious
goal of a fully fledged system (WP7) from the relatively risk free
goal of a core system (WP6). We have concrete plans to collaborate
with experts on each work package - see {\em Pathways to Impact}. We
will manage the project by 6-monthly team meetings and by asking our
collaborators to formally review our progress after two years.  Our
significant and succesful track records of working together -
including managing similar multi-institutional grants - indicate
this is the right level of management.

% UK HoTT exists!

{\bf The RAs and Training.} As explained in the {\em
  Justification of Resources}, we require two RAs and recent events
such as the Trimester in Certified Proof in Paris and the Special Year
on HoTT in Princeton have created a significant pool of potential
RAs. Nevertheless, we will advertise widely to recruit the best RAs
possible.  FOP group, Leeds Logic, and MSP group meetings provide
regular opportunities to report on research progress and generate new
ideas, and will help integrate the RA into the project and the highly
conducive local environments. Further training will include i) reading
groups for studying relevant papers; ii) ensuring the RAs play
prominent roles in meetings (eg UK HoTT, ScotCats, SPLS, MGS, FitA) we
attend/organise; iii) writing of papers and grant proposals; and
iv) leading research activities and helping mentor PhD students.
The RAs will thus gain highly-desirable
knowledge and skills and be well-positioned to lead future research
and/or development work. This is vital as the development of
next generation programming languages requires more work than the
active workforce can handle. Overall, the proposed project will have
high impact in terms of training.

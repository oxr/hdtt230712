{\bf Cost of Software Failure:} The cost of software failure is truly
staggering. Well known individual cases include the Mars Climate
Orbiter failure ($\pounds 80$ million), Ariane Rocket disaster
($\pounds 350$ million), Pentium Chip Division failure ($\pounds 300$
million), and more recently the heartbleed bug (upto $\pounds 250$K per
server). There are many, many more examples. Even worse, other
software failures such as one in the Patriot Missile System and
another in the Therac-25 radiation system have costs lives. More
generally, a 2008 study by the US government estimated that faulty
software costs the US economy $\pounds 40$ billion annually.  As a
result, the human and economic importance of ensuring programs run
without error is hard to over-estimate. Further, this importance will
only grow significantly as software becomes ever more ubiquitous in
our lives and economy.

Formal verification uses mathematical techniques to prove that
programs actually perform the computations they are intended to
perform and/or avoid performing unintended ones. One major approach to
software correctness is {\em language-based verification}, in which
successful compilation of programs provides machine certification of
their correctness. Language-based verification thus supports the
development of software that is {\em correct by construction}, which
is the logical conclusion of the persistent trend in software
engineering toward ever earlier program verification; examples of
their use are given in the main body of the proposal. Although the
proposed research --- namely, the construction of the first of a new
breed of programming language and verification environments based upon
HoTT --- does not lend itself to immediate industrial uptake, we have
devised the following five-point plan for maximising its impact:

\vspace*{0.02in}

$\bullet$ {\bf Publication:} We will, of course, pursue the kinds of
publication venues all good scientists pursue. Principally, we will
produce high-quality papers and endeavour to publish them in the best
journals. Publication of our papers in leading archival journals will
confer validation by the community of the correctness and importance
our our results, as well as allow them to serve as seminal references.
However, the tradition in computer science is also to aim for early
publication of important results to keep pace with the rapidly
changing nature of the discipline. We will therefore also seek to
publish our key results in top conferences. We expect each of our work
packages to result in at least two publications and several to result
in more.

\vspace*{0.02in} $\bullet$ {\bf Scientific
  Interaction:} %We are active members of our
To increase the impact of our research, we will continue to interact
with our research community via %the internet,
conferences, research visits, and other meetings. For example, within the UK, Prof
Ghani co-founded the Scottish Category Theory Seminar while Dr McBride
co-founded Fun in the Afternoon. They are both active members of the
Scottish Programming Languages Seminar and SICSA, the Scottish computer science pooling
body. More generally, Scotland is an excellent place to interact with
other researchers on a regular informal basis: there
are %. Indeed, there are
strong programming languages and verification research groups at Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Heriot Watt, and St Andrews, and there are also Scottish Theorem
Proving meetings. Further afield, we will interact with researchers
from across the UK. We have excellent contacts at all the major
relevant research groups, and although distance will make interactions
with them less frequent, that in itself will provide fresh
perspectives as the grant progresses. 

At a more detailed level, we are already committed to host a
specialist workshop in HoTT in Strathclyde towards the end of 2014
which has been partially funded by the LMS. This workshop is exactly
the kind of high-impact event --- targeted at a small number of
experts and in a very specific area --- that truly aids and
disseminates research. Our experience is that by careful choice of
time and location, we can attract significant numbers from both Europe
and further afield to such workshops and the attractiveness of our
workshops will be enhanced by inviting key leaders in the
field. Because of the value of such workshops, we intend to hold a
follow-up workshop during the project and have therefore requested
funding for this within the proposal budget.  The cost is entirely
minimal compared to the opportunities such focussed meetings offer.



%\item 

\vspace*{0.02in}

$\bullet$ {\bf Collaboration:} To further maximise impact, we have
invited a number of internationally leading project partners to work
with us on specific work packages of the proposed research (see
below). This is advantageous in several ways. First, working
with these project partners will enhance the scientific
quality of the proposed research. Secondly, working with these
partners will mean that they are intimately involved with the proposed
research; in effect, thorough dissemination of our ideas will be
occurring with our partners even as the work is being done, and this
will %kick-start the process of getting 
help get our ideas out into the broader
research community. Finally, drawing on a variety of different
perspectives will help ensure that the proposed research does not
become overly insular, but instead is outward-looking and
solves important problems in key application areas.



Our project partners are Prof~Steve Awodey(CMU, WP1), Prof~Thierry
Coquand (Chalmers, WP2), ?? (??, WP3), Dr Nick Benton (Microsoft,
WP4), ?? (??, WP5), ?? (??, WP6), ?? (??, WP7) and Dr Andrew Kennedy
(Microsoft, WP8). We have thus secured the involvement of an
industrial partner for each of the impact generating work packages
in. In terms of maximising impact, the collaboration with Kennedy is
the closest we come to actual industrial crossover. Since Kennedy's
original units of measure system has been incorporated into
Microsoft's $F\#$, the generalisation we propose to develop may do as
well. Although it is not the main focus of the proposed research, we
will certainly investigate this possibility. 
%\item 



\vspace*{0.02in}

$\bullet$ {\bf The Stream Model:} One prevalent model of research is
the {\em stream model}. Under this model, to solve a problem one looks
both ``upstream'' for fundamental theoretical ideas to feed into the
research, and ``downstream'' for validation of the research by those
who stand to benefit as end-users. This model maximises impact by
ensuring that research is picked up not only by those working on the
same problem, but also by those upstream, who will be interested in
how their own work is applied, and by those downstream, who will look
to apply it to their work.  To help ensure that the proposed research
has a high impact we will follow this stream model.

Upstream of us there is a significant number of mathematicians and
theoretical computer scientists working on the foundations of HoTT,
and whose results we will enhance and apply to develop our environment
for programming with HoTT. Downstream, those in the programming
languages and program verification communities are already interested
in applying HoTT to their work, but the lack of an actual programming
language hinders them from doing so. Thus our tools will be exactly
what they need to progress the uptake of HoTT by the broader
programming languages community. 

\vspace*{0.02in}

$\bullet$ {\bf The Work Packages:} Our main consideration in
developing our work packages is the quality of the scientific ideas
underlying them, since high-impact research obviously requires
high-quality ideas. For the specific research proposed here it also
requires i) not just a much better understanding of the current
literature on HoTT but substantial contributions to it; ii) not just
theoretical ideas presented in a way that theoreticians can
understand, but also concrete program languages and verification tools
that programmers can understand and use on their own terms; and iii)
not just evidence of the overall power of our new tools, but also a
collection of examples outlining a methodology for deploying them.
These three requirements guided our designing the work packages. WP1-3
make significant contributions to the literature on HoTT while WP4
generates impact from these work packages by developing examples to
illustrate their results. Similarly, WP5-7 focusses taking the
theoretical results we will achieve and using them to build our
tools. Finally WP8 generates impact from these tools by developing
case studies where they are used thereby making them
directly usable by non-specialists.  

\vspace*{0.02in}

$\bullet$ {\bf Hidden Foundations:} Although the language and
verification tools produced will be based on HoTT, what users of our
tools will see is a clean, modern programming language whose use
requires no knowledge of the underlying foundations of HoTT. We have
already applied this ``hidden foundations" approach to mathematical
descriptions of programming language artefacts where the mathematics
is used to organise the structure of a programming language but not
used in programming itself. However, even in the foundational work
packages, we will still use the hidden foundations approach, e.g., by
comprehensively treating special models of interest and by showcasing
our results via examples as much as possible. This will allow those
with modest or no mathematical background to use and profit from our
all of our research to the best extent possible.

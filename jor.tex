\noindent While EPSRC is principally interested in the quality of
research, costs must be justified. It is argued below that i) all four
investigators are required for the proposed research because they have
distinct-but-necessary skills; ii) the hours per week spent on
the grant by the investigators are required; iii)  two RAs are required because of the
breadth and volume of the work proposed; iv) the duration of the
grant is appropriate given the volume of the work involved and the
fast moving nature of HoTT research; and v) the travel budget
is needed to underpin the planned collaborations, workshops, and
attendance at conferences. In addition, extra value for money arises
as Strathclyde and Nottingham have agreed to
each fund and extra PhD student from the overheads of this grant.

\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf The Investigators:} All four investigators have
excellent track records in the areas of the proposed research: i)
Altenkirch is an expert in type theory and the syntactic presentation
of HoTT --- in particular his work on OTT, Cubical Type Theory,
Containers, modelling type theory in type theory and the experimental
programming language $\Pi\Sigma$ has direct relevance to WPs
2,3,5,6,7; ii) Gambino is an expert in category theory with his work
on the semantic foundations of HoTT and dependent polynomials having
direct relevance to WPs 1,3; iii) Ghani is an expert on the
categorical foundations of programming languages with his work on
logical relations, containers, effects and units of measure being
particularly relevant to WP1, 2, 3, 4 and 8; and iv) McBride is an
expert on the definition and implementation of programming languages
with his work on containers, OTT, effects and Epigram being
particularly relevant to WPs 3,4,6,7. These skills directly map onto
the management of the proposal as follows. WP1 will be led
by Leeds as Gambino is the strongest researcher on the semantics of
HoTT, while WPs 2,3 and 5 will be lead by Nottingham as they reflect
strengths of Dr Altenkirch on the type theoretic foundations of
programming languages. Finally WPs 4,6,7 and 8 will be lead by
Strathclyde given their expertise in dependently typed
programming. Ghani's role --- apart from the scientific
contributions above --- will be to knit the theoretical
research at Nottingham and Leeds with applied
research at Strathclyde.

\noindent Our general background and specific experience means that
we are one of the few groups who could conduct this research. We are
also a {\em very well balanced team} spanning the breadth of the
proposal from theory to practice and having two implementors of
programming languages --- Altenkirch ($\Pi\Sigma$) and McBride
(Epigram) --- will ensure robust discussions from different
perspectives which will help push the applied research forward.
Indeed, removing anyone from the project would significantly
reduce the strength of the team and the prospects for
completion. Within the team, Gambino is essential because of his
knowledge of the semantic foundations of HoTT and links with the grant
of Awodey, Altenkirch is essential for his work on the type theoretic
foundations of HoTT, Ghani is essential because of his work on logical
relations and McBride is essential for the depth of his understanding
of the implementation of functional programming languages.  As a
result, having each investigator on the proposed research is
indispensable. Of course, as we have argued, the investigators also
have other overlapping skills and hence all investigators will be
involved in all areas of the research so that we can contribute to,
and be advised of, all progress. In summary, we are ambitious people
who want to change the world we live in and who believe we have the
mathematical and computational skills to do exactly that.



\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf Hours per Week:} 
Each investigator will spend 20\% of their time on the project.
This means that on average they will devote one
full day per week the project. These workloads are standard for such projects, and
our experience of research management suggests any less is 
unrealistic. This allows the investigators to devote the significant
time required by the proposed research proposal while still discharging
their other responsibilities.

\vspace{0.02in}



\noindent {\bf The RAs:} The volume of work is clearly too much to be
undertaken by the investigators alone. Further, PhD students cannot be
trained in subjects like category theory, type theory, and the use and
development of program language and verification tools, and still have
enough time to conduct the proposed research. Full-time RAs are
therefore needed on this project. We had originally hoped that one RA
would suffice, but both the amount of the work and the highly distinct
skills needed between the theoretical foundations and the more
practical aspects of the project mean that we need one RA with skills
in each of these areas. In a nutshell, the volume and breadth of the
proposed research means it would be unrealistic to expect it to be
undertaken by a sole RA. The RAs will certainly need to have PhDs and,
given the diverse and specialised nature of the research, will ideally
have postdoctoral experience as well.  Such appointments are feasible
because there are a number of PhD students and RAs working in exactly
these areas, e.g., in the Coq and Agda development teams and also PhD
students who have been following the numerous summer schools that
interest in HoTT has sparked.  Although the RA will be expected to be
able to work independently, our own strengths means the RAs will be
closely managed by the investigators. They will be asked to work with
the project partners and collaborators of the investigators, to push
the project ahead; to contribute to the writing of papers and grant
proposals; and, as part of their general training, to help mentor PhD
students. A Grade 7, Point 29 salary of $\pounds$28,839 is the minimum
for newly-minted PhDs, so a Grade 7, Point 35 salary of
$\pounds$35,597 will give us the flexibility to employ the more senior
RAs who have indicated their interest in applying. The small extra
cost is more than outweighed by the benefits their greater breadth and
depth that they bring to the project. The balance of the team will be
maintained by hiring one RA on WP1-4 at Nottingham and one RA on WP5-8
at Strathclyde. However, we will expect each to be conversant in the
other's area and thus to be able to work and collaborate with all
members of the team.

%The position will be
%required for four years to have time to fully integrate the RAs into
%the project, make progress on the proposed research, and then
%evaluate and refine the results obtained. Given the fast moving nature
%of this area of research, this length of time will allow us to absorb
%progress as it is made across the world.

\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf Duration of the Grant:} The appropriate duration for
this project is 4 years. We have proposed 8 very high quality work
packages and while each has a conceptually straightforward deliverable
(to ensure the project can proceed as a whole), it would be a mistake
to underestimate the amount of technical work required to formalise these
concepts to the level of rigour required. On top of this,
we want to tackle the more ambitious goals in our work packages as
they will produce better overall results in terms of the programming
tools developed and the case studies we carry out. Finally,
HoTT is a fast-moving subject and 4 years gives us time to absorb and
make use of breakthroughs likely to arise in the near future.
Moreover, the time required to implement and formally prove properties
within a proof system is an order of magnitude greater than for
equivalent pencil-and-paper proofs. This is the price of extra
rigour. Allocating 4 years to the project gives us reasonable amounts
of time to conclude the work in the various packages
% --- this will be a stiff challenge, but we want to
%aim high and already have the ideas to make this feasible 
--- and also
provides sufficient time at the end of the project to serve as a
safety cushion in case any of the work packages run into unforeseen
difficulties.

%Given that four years is a reasonable amount of time to undertake the
%proposed research, one may wonder if 
\noindent Each work packages is necessary --- certainly WP1 is needed
to provide the semantic criteria against which the 
rest of our research can be judged, WP2 is needed to turn the semantic
model of HoTT from WP1 into a syntactic presentation of HoTT, WP3 is
needed since HITs are one of the exciting new features of HoTT, and
WP4 will be used to generate impact from HITs by applying them to a
significant problem in computer science, namely the theory of
effects. WP5 is needed to formally verify the correctness of our results, while WP6 and WP7 together form the programming language
we aim to develop. The value of them will be demonstrated with
concrete examples in WP8.  Thus, dropping any of the work packages
would clearly diminish the project.

\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf Travel Budget:} The investigators and the RAs will
attend conferences and workshops relevant to the research:
international conferences such as LICS, ICFP, POPL, Types, TLCA, MPC,
MSFP, TFP, CSL, and ICALP. Each team member will attend two
conferences per year at an estimated average cost of $\pounds 1000$
per trip, for a total of $\pounds 48$K. Within Computer science,
conference presentation and publication are the principal means of
assessing quality, disseminating, and attracting feedback
on our research results. They are also vital to keeping abreast of
the related research. The cost per conference
is accurate since most conferences will be in Europe and cost
approximately $\pounds 300$ for registration, $\pounds 250$ for
travel, $\pounds 200$ for subsistence, and $\pounds 250$ for
accommodation. The cost of the occasional conference further afield
will be offset by savings on occasional conferences in the UK. We have also asked for $\pounds 32$K for four
research visits to each of our eight collaborators --- their active
participation will provide significant added value while the costs of
the visits are minimal when taken over 4 years. Each visit will be for
approximately one week and the costs are entirely standard covering
travel and basic subsistence. Finally, Dr Gambino has held a UK HoTT
meeting this year which was highly successful and Prof Ghani is
scheduled to hold the next one in Jan 2015. We will hold another
workshop half way through the grant and plan to invite each of our
collaborators as invited speakers so as to aid their formal review of
the project. This increases the quality of the review, the
attractiveness of the workshop and thus the possibilities for
disseminating our results and learning from other researchers. At the
end of the grant, we will hold a summer school to demonstrate and
disseminate our results. Altenkirch, Ghani and McBride have
significant experience of the educational benefits of such 
events through their work in the MGS. We have requested \pounds 6K for
the workshop and another \pounds 6K for the summer school ... these
are very small costs when taken against the benefits they create in
terms of facilitating exchange of ideas and generating greater
impact. We also require money for travel internally to the research
team. We plan 2 group meetings per year and request funds for 2
further trips per person per year. As these are all UK trips, we
estimate \pounds 500 per trip. Again these are minimal costs and
certainly required as face-to-face meetings are highly productive.

%\noindent {\bf Consumables:} The RA will require a PC. However, PCs
%for RAs are not provided by the University, so we request one
%here. The cost for this is $\pounds 1000$. This is an entirely
%standard request with standard pricing.

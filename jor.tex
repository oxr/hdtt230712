\noindent While EPSRC is principally interested in the quality of
research, costs must be justified. It is argued below that i) all four
investigators are required because they have
distinct-but-necessary skills; ii) the hours per week spent on
the grant by the investigators are required; iii)  two RAs are required because of the
breadth and volume of the work proposed; iv) the duration of the
grant is appropriate given the volume of the work involved and the
fast moving nature of HoTT research; v) the travel budget
is needed to underpin the planned collaborations, workshops, and
attendance at conferences; and vi) a small consumables budget is
needed. Extra value for money arises
as Strathclyde and Nottingham 
each fund and extra PhD student from the overheads of this grant, and
because each of our collaborators are giving 4 weeks of their time to
collaborate on this project.

\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf The Investigators:} 
All investigators have excellent track records for this research as is
detailed in the main case for support.  We are also a {\em very well
  balanced team} spanning the breadth of the proposal from theory to
practice. Having two implementors of programming languages ---
Altenkirch ($\Pi\Sigma$) and McBride (Epigram) --- will ensure robust
discussions from different perspectives which will help push the
applied research forward. Ghani, Altenkirch and Gambino's varied
theoretical expertises will similarly push forward the more
foundational research. The mathematical sophistication of HoTT, and
the intricacies of implementation, mean this depth and breadth of
knowledge is essential to the project, makes us one of the few groups
who could conduct this research, and partially explains why this
clearly important research hasn't been undertaken yet.

\noindent Although the investigators posses overlapping areas of expertise as
detailed above, they also uniquely posses a depth of knowledge
in a vital area of the project. This means that removing any
investigator from the project would significantly reduce the strength
of the team and the prospects for successful completion. For example,
Gambino is essential because no other investigator possesses his depth
of knowledge of the semantic foundations of HoTT or his links with the
grant of Awodey. Similarly, Altenkirch is essential as no other
investigator possesses his depth of knowledge, or preparatory work, on
the syntactic presentation HoTT. Ghani is similarly essential because
of the depth of his knowledge of logical relations and McBride is
similarly essential for the depth of his understanding of the
implementation of functional programming languages. On the other hand,
the investigators' overlapping skills ensures that all investigators
will be involved in all areas of the research so that we can work
as one unified team rather than 4 individual investigators. This is
feasible because Gambino and Ghani have some experience with
Coq, Haskell and Agda and McBride's facility with OTT means he has some experience with
the ideas and motivations of HoTT. Ghani's role --- apart from the
scientific contributions above --- will be to use his location at
Strathclyde and knowledge in the more foundational areas of the
project to knit the theoretical research at Nottingham and Leeds with
the applied research at Strathclyde. In summary, we are an ambitious
team who want to change the world we live in and believe we that,
collectively, we have the mathematical and computational skills to do
exactly that.





\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf Hours per Week:} 
Each investigator will spend 20\% of their time on the project.  This
means that on average they will devote one full day per week the
project. These workloads are standard for such projects, and our
experience of research management suggests any less is totally
unrealistic given the volume of the work required and the time needed
to keep abreast of other developments in the project and elsewhere in
the world.  On the other hand, a commitment of 20\% of their time
allows the investigators to devote the significant time required by
the proposed research while still discharging their other essential
responsibilities.

\vspace{0.02in}



\noindent {\bf The RAs:} 
The volume and sophistication of work is clearly too much to be
undertaken by the investigators alone or by PhD students.  Full-time
RAs are therefore needed on this project. We had originally hoped that
one RA would suffice, but both the volume of the work (especially
within implementation, verification and the development of inherently
open-ended case studies) and the highly distinct skills needed between
the theoretical foundations and the more practical aspects of the
project means it would be totally unrealistic to expect it to be
undertaken by a sole RA. Thus we definitely need two RAs. These RAs
will ideally be experienced


 and, given
our desire to work as one cohesive unit, both RAs will need to have
some skills in the others area so that each can benefit from, and
contribute to, research across the project. This will produce a
multiplier effect due to the benefits of collaboration and
cross-fertilisation between their areas. The benefits will thus be
greater than that of having two RAs work on two separate projects ---
having two separate projects would not work anyway as each half of the
project is inextricably linked with the other.  The RAs will work with
the project partners and collaborators of the investigators, to push
the project ahead; to contribute to the writing of papers and grant
proposals; and, as part of their general training, to help mentor PhD
students. 


A Grade 7, Point 29 salary of $\pounds$28,839 is the minimum
for newly-minted PhDs, so a Grade 7, Point 35 salary of
$\pounds$35,597 will give us the flexibility to employ the more senior
RAs who have the required skill set needed by this project. The
small extra cost is more than outweighed by the benefits of the
greater breadth and depth that experienced RAs bring to the
project. The balance of the team will be maintained by hiring one RA
on WP1-4 at Nottingham and one RA on WP5-8 at Strathclyde. These more
senior RA appointments are feasible because there are a number of RAs
working in exactly these areas (e.g. in the Coq and Agda development
teams) or who have been following the numerous summer schools that
interest in HoTT has sparked (e.g. at the Trimester in Certified Proof
in Paris and the Special Year on HoTT). Examples include Dr Ondrej
Rypacek and Dr James Chapman who have indicated their interest should the grant be funded.








\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf Duration of the Grant:} The appropriate duration for
this project is 4 years. We have proposed 8 very high quality work
packages and while each has an achievable deliverable
(to ensure the project can proceed as a whole), it would be a mistake
to underestimate the amount of technical work required to formalise
these concepts to the level of rigour required. On top of this, we
want to tackle the more ambitious goals in our work packages as they
will produce better overall results in terms of the programming tools
developed and the case studies we carry out. Finally, HoTT is a
fast-moving subject and 4 years gives us time to absorb and make use
of breakthroughs likely to arise in the near future.  Moreover, the
time required to implement and formally prove properties within a
proof system is an order of magnitude greater than for equivalent
pencil-and-paper proofs. This is the price of extra rigour. Allocating
4 years to the project gives us reasonable amounts of time to conclude
the work in the various packages --- and also provides sufficient time
at the end of the project to serve as a safety cushion in case any of
the work packages run into unforeseen difficulties.


\noindent Each work package is vital: WP1 provides
the semantic criteria against which the rest of our
research can be validated, WP2 is needed to turn the semantic model of
HoTT from WP1 into a syntactic presentation of HoTT, WP3 is needed
since HITs are one of the exciting new features of HoTT, and WP4 will
be used to generate impact from HITs by applying them to a significant
problem in computer science, namely the theory of effects. WP5 is
needed to machine check the correctness of our foundations,
programming language tools and case studies, while WP6,7
together form the programming language we aim to develop. The
value of them will be demonstrated with in WP8.
Thus, dropping any of the work packages would clearly diminish the
project.

\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf Travel Budget:} Within CS, conference publication vital
for assessing the quality of research disseminating its results,
attracting feedback and keeping abreast of the related research.  We
will attend two conferences per year at an estimated average cost of
$\pounds 1000$ per trip, for a total of $\pounds 48$K. The cost per
conference is accurate since most conferences will be in Europe and
cost approximately $\pounds 300$ for registration, $\pounds 250$ for
travel, $\pounds 200$ for subsistence, and $\pounds 250$ for
accommodation. The cost of occasional conferences further afield if
offset by occasional conferences in the UK. Example conferences are
LICS, ICFP, POPL, Types, TLCA, MPC, MSFP, TFP, CSL, and ICALP.  We
have also asked for $\pounds 32$K for 4 research visits to each of
our 8 collaborators --- their active participation will provide
significant added value while the cost is minimal when
taken over 4 years. Each visit will be approximately one week and the
costs are standard covering travel and basic subsistence. Dr
Gambino held a highly successful UK HoTT meeting this year and Prof
Ghani will host one in Jan 2015. We propose another workshop half way
through the grant and plan to invite  our collaborators as
invited speakers --- this will increase the quality of their formal
review, the attractiveness of the workshop and thus our ability to
disseminate our results and learn from other researchers. At the end
of the grant, we will hold a summer school to demonstrate and
disseminate our results. Altenkirch, Ghani and McBride have
significant experience of the educational benefits of such events
through their work in the MGS. We request \pounds 6K for the workshop
and \pounds 6K for the summer school --- these are very small costs
when taken against the benefits of facilitating exchange of ideas and
generating greater impact. We also require money for travel within the
team. We request funds for 2 group meetings per year and for 2 further
trips per person per year. As these are all UK trips, we estimate
\pounds 500 per trip giving a total of \pounds 48K. Again these are
minimal costs and certainly required as face-to-face meetings are
highly productive. Overall, the travel budget is about 10\% of the
entire budget which is standard.

\vspace{0.02in}

\noindent {\bf Consumables:} The RAs require a PC and also a
laptop because this grant involves and unusually large amount of travel to take
advantage of the input of our collaborators. These are not provided by
our Universities and so one each is requested for each RA. The cost is
$\pounds 4x1000$ --- an entirely standard
pricing.

The work will start simultaneously in Leeds on Semantic
Foundations (WP1), in Nottingham on Univalent Type Theory (WP2) and in
Strathclyde by work on Formalisation of the required Meta-Theory
(WP5). We expect this work to be heavily intertwined and proceeding in
parallel. After progress is made on WP2, Nottingham will start looking
into Higher Inductive Types (WP3) as we expect these to be useful in
WP2 as well. As the work on WP1 progresses and comes to a successfull
end, the attention of Nicola Gambino in Leeds will move to HITs as
well, given his expertise in the area. In the meantime, Strathclyde,
having laid the matfoundations in WP5 will begin formalising the Type
Theory produced in WP2 in Nottingham. As the work on implementation
progresses, higher level will be considered (WP6) with the findings
back propagating both to WP5 and WP3. In the final stage Nottingham
will seek apply the type theory to formalising effectful programming
(WP4) while Strathclyde gradually move onto case studies. However the
work on WP7 is not finished until it's utility is tested in WP8. Both
teams will depend on Leeds support in foundational matters in this period.

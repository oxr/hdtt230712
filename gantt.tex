{\bf Relationships between work packages:} The following direct
relationships between work packages feed into the design of the above
Gantt chart. WP1,5 start immediately as both have no prerequisites ---
the latter will begin by formalising the cubical set model. We want to
start WP2 early as this is one of the key work packages and we already
have a ideas to pursue within Altenkirch's Cubical Type Theory. As WP1
progresses, its results will feed into WP2. Similarly, another key
work package is our core language of WP6 so we start this one year into
the project enabling the results of WP2 to feed into it. WP3 needs to
be integrated with our syntactic and semantic foundations and so
starts after these work packages have had time to deliver
results. Similarly, WP7 builds upon WP6 and WP3 and so starts after
those work packages have had time to deliver results. WP4 builds upon
WP3 as is reflected in its start date. Finally, once most of our tools
are developed, we start WP8.

{\bf Duration:} The longest work package is WP5 as this is where our
formal verificaton takes place. We want to formally verify as many
results as possible, particularly about our model theory, about our
type theory, about our programming language, and about our application
to Units of Measure. As a result this is the longest work package which
(with a break for language development) will be undertaken at both the
beginning and the end of the project. The next most important
work packages in terms of overall goals and impact are WP2,6,7 and so
they are allocated 2 years each. The other work packages are slightly
less fundamental and so are given 1.5 years apart from WP8 which we think
will only need 1 year as WP8 is more tightly scoped than the other
work packages and so probably requires only one year.

Nevertheless, there is flexibility in these lengths to either extend
or shorten work packages as the pace of progress within them becomes
evident. For example, if our work on WP6,7 delivers the required
platform, we will start work on WP8 earlier and look for extensions
to the research proposed. The timing and duration of these work
packages means we are in a fortunate position in that both the more
theoretical RA at Nottingham (WP1--4) and the more applied RA (WP5--8)
will not have to work on more than one work package at a time.

{\bf Leadership:} WP1 will be jointly led by Nottingham and Leeds as
both sites have considerable experience there. Having joint leadership
in this work package will not be a problem due to the close proximity
and the experience we have gained of working together over this
proposal. Indeed, this will be advantageous as the Nottingham RA will
get to work closely with Gambino. Ghani's experience in category
theory will make him a secondary contributor on WP1. WP2--4 will be led
at Nottingham as Altenkirch has signfiicant experience in all of these
areas. Neverthless, McBride's experience in type theory and Ghani's
experience in logical relations will mean they are secondary
contributors to WP2. All investigators have experience in, and hence
will contribute to, WP3. Ghani and McBride will similarly contribute
to WP4 because of their work on effects. WP5--8 will be led at
Strathclyde but Altenkirch will be a secondary contributor to
WP5--7. McBride will take the lead on WP5--7 while Ghani will take
the lead on WP8 because of his experience working with Kennedy on
Units of Measure.

The largest risk is the 
amount of {\em engineering} work required by programming language
and verification tools --- this risk is mitigated by Dr McBride's
presence in the team and our 
separation of the ambitious
goal of a fully fledged system (WP7) from the more modest
goal of a core system (WP6). Risk throughout the project is reduced by
our plans to collaborate
with experts on each work package --- see {\em Pathways to Impact}.

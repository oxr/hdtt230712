Our general objective is to make Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) available to researchers and programmers so that they are able to apply this new foundational system in formal verification and high-level program development. In more detail, we have the following objectives.

1. Determine whether and how HoTT can be used to increase reusability and modularity in formal verification and dependently typed programming. This includes a study of how HoTT can be used in the context of programming with effects. (WP4, WP8)

2. Provide high-level tools which other researchers who want to use HoTT can use and apply. (WP6, WP7)

3. Develop a clear definition and implementation of core HoTT satisfying basic metatheoretical properties such as normalisiation and canonicty (e.g. all closed numbers reduce to numerals) including a general notion of higher inductive types. (WP2, WP3, WP6)

4. Develop the metatheory of HoTT by analyzing model construction and use this to obtain potential extensions of HoTT. (WP 1)
